Project Euler - Haskell
=======================

Each exercise is a separate Stack project.

Building
--------
To build, either run `cabal build` or `stack build`.

Testing
-------
To test, either run `cabal test` or `stack test`.

The tests are usually simply the one given in the problem description and then
the correct answer, once known.

Running
-------
To run, either run `cabal run` or `stack exec eulerXXX-exe` where XXX is
the problem number. This will simply print out the answer to the problem.

Reminder
--------
If you use these to cheat on the exercises, you're only cheating yourself.
