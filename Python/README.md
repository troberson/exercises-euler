Project Euler - Python
======================

Each exercise is independent. All require Python 3 due to type annotations.

Running
-------
To run, either run `python3 eulerXXX.py` or `./eulerXXX.py` where XXX is
the problem number. This will simply print out the answer to the problem.
The shebang is set to `#!/usr/bin/env python3` which should work for most
\*nix machines.

Testing
-------
To test, run `pytest`.

The tests are usually simply the one given in the problem description and then
the correct answer, once known.


Reminder
--------
If you use these to cheat on the exercises, you're only cheating yourself.
