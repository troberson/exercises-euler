Project Euler - C++ 
=======================

Each exercise is a separate CMake project.

Building
--------
To build a project, run
```
cd euler001
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Testing
-------
To test, run `ctest` from the build directory. 

The tests are usually simply the one given in the problem description and then
the correct answer, once known.

Running
-------
The binaries are in "bin/" under the build directory. Running them will simply print out the answer to the problem.

Reminder
--------
If you use these to cheat on the exercises, you're only cheating yourself.
